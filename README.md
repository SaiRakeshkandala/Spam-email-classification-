- 📊 **Feature extraction** with TF-IDF for meaningful representation.
- 🤖 **Model training** using Naive Bayes for efficient classification.
- 🚀 **Real-time predictions** via a Flask-based web application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - Scikit-learn 🤖  
  - NLTK 🛠️  
  - Flask 🌐  
- **Deployment:** Flask API with Python backend.
